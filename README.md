# THIS LIBRARY HAS BEEN ABANDONED

Due to this library's limited flexibility and certain poor design choices, it has been abandoned is no longer maintained.

**However, a new library, [iCanteen Menu Extractor](https://github.com/vitlabuda/icanteen-menu-extractor), which offers
the same functionality, but it features a better design and extended flexibility, has been programmed from scratch.**

The original README file of this repository can be found under the name [README-old.md](README-old.md).
